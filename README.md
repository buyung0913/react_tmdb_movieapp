cd react_tmdb_app

```

### 4. Run the project

```bash

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User logs in with **TMDB username & password**
2. `request_token` is requested from `/authentication/token/new`
3. Token is validated with login (`/token/validate_with_login`)
4. If successful, `session_id` is created and stored in `localStorage`
5. All further requests include `session_id`

---

## 🧪 Development Tips

- All TMDB requests go through Axios instance in `src/api/tmdbApi.js`
- Auth state is globally handled in `authStore.js`
- DI via `useDI()` hook in components/views
- Movie listing uses `movieModel.getMovieList(...)`
